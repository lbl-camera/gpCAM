# gpCAM API Levels

gpCAM comes with two main libraries: The GPOptimizer, for single task Gaussian processes and Bayesian Optimization, and the fvGPOptimizer
for the multi-task eqivalent.
Both are capable of dealing with non-Euclidean input spaces and world-record-holding scaling of exact GPs.

To get to know gpCAM, check out the examples on this website, download the repository and go to "./tests", or visit the project [website](https://gpcam.lbl.gov/).
